找Bug或者提需求
---------------------------

You can report bugs, or request features that you think should be in Pygame
Zero, using the `Github issue tracker`_.

Here are some things to bear in mind before you do this:

* It might not just be you! You should check if someone has already reported
  the issue by searching through the existing issues - both open and closed.

* The developers need to know what version of Pygame Zero you are using, and
  what operating system you are running (Windows, Mac, Linux etc) and version
  (Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04, etc).

如何在Github上提P/R
------------------------

You can make changes to Pygame Zero by creating a pull request.

It's a good idea to :ref:`report an issue <report-issue>` first, so that we can
discuss whether your change makes sense.

Github has `help on how to create a pull request`__, but here's the quick
version:

   Remember to change ``yourusername`` to your Github username.

        git add pgzero

8. Commit the files with a clear commit message::

安裝開發版本
------------------------

It's possible to create a locally-editable install using pip. From the root directory of the checked out source, run::

    pip3 install --editable .

The installed version will now reflect any local changes you make.

Alternatively, if you don't want to install it at all, it may be run with:

   python3 -m pgzero <name of pgzero script>

For example:

   python3 -m pgzero examples/basic/demo1.py


如何運行測試
----------------

The tests can be run with

    python3 setup.py test
